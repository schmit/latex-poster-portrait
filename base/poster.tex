% Default mode is landscape, which is what we want, however dvips and
% a0poster do not quite do the right thing, so we end up with text in
% landscape style (wide and short) down a portrait page (narrow and
% long). Printing this onto the a0 printer chops the right hand edge.
% However, 'psnup' can save the day, reorienting the text so that the
% poster prints lengthways down an a0 portrait bounding box.

% Set up the grid
%
% Note that [40mm,40mm] is the margin round the edge of the page --
% it is _not_ the grid size. That is always defined as
% PAGE_WIDTH/HGRID and PAGE_HEIGHT/VGRID. In this case we use
% 23 x 12. This gives us three columns of width 7 boxes, with a gap of
% width 1 in between them. 12 vertical boxes is a good number to work
% with.
%
% Note however that texblocks can be positioned fractionally as well,
% so really any convenient grid size can be used.
%
\TPGrid[40mm,40mm]{15}{12}      % 2 cols of width 7, plus a gaps width 1

% Understanding textblocks is the key to being able to do a poster in
% LaTeX. In
%
%    \begin{textblock}{wid}(x,y)
%    ...
%    \end{textblock}
%
% the first argument gives the block width in units of the grid
% cells specified above in \TPGrid; the second gives the (x,y)
% position on the grid, with the y axis pointing down.

% You will have to do a lot of previewing to get everything in the
% right place.

% This gives good title positioning for a portrait poster.
% Watch out for hyphenation in titles - LaTeX will do it
% but it looks awful.
